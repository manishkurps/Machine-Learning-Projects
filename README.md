## SVM for predicting Closing Price for Three different Bank stock datasets
Comparing  SVR model with Kernel = Radial Basis Function Kernel, in their effectiveness when applied to predict Closing price of SBI, HDFC and ICICI Stock. A much detailed approach can be found on the accompanying [Medium article](https://medium.com/@rupesh1684/stock-market-prediction-using-machine-learning-model-svm-e4aaca529886)

### Results (Accuracy)
- SBI score : 97.28%
- HDFC score : 88.58%
- ICICi score : 97.33%

### RMSE and R-square
- SBI :
   - RMSE:6.22
   - R-square score:0.56
- HDFC :
   - RMSE:15.53
   - R-square score:0.60
- ICICI :
   - RMSE:7.04
   - R-square score:0.48

 **Best Configuration = Lower RMSE and higher R-square score**

### Interpretation

**With the above RMSE and an RÂ² score using SVR with the RBF kernel, the model's predictive accuracy is relatively moderate.**
